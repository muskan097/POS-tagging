# POS(Part-of-speech) tagging

From a very small age, we have been made accustomed to identifying part of speech tags. For example, reading a sentence and being able to identify what words act as nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and so on. All these are referred to as the part of speech tags.

It is not possible to manually find out different part-of-speech tags for a given corpus. New types of contexts and new words keep coming up in dictionaries in various languages, and manual POS tagging is not scalable in itself. That is why we rely on machine-based POS tagging.

But why we need POS tagging?
The main benefits of POS tagging would be to do some sort of information retrieval, indexing, and classification. By tagging the various parts of a textual piece of content you can very easily spot its noun phrases, verbal phrases, and therefore deduct the main objects, subjects, as well as actions. By fine-tuning your application logic, you can then clean up stop words and extract the essence of a piece of text — be it a tweet, a research paper, a video transcribed, or the entire Internet in Google’s case.

Once you have tagged parts of speech, you may then decide to compute a dependency tree to see what root words get the most attention, and what qualifiers and modifiers get used to most with them, and why.
